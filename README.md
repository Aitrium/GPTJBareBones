# GPT-J BareBones Engine
## Description
This is the barebones version of the GPT-J engine we use for Aitrium's AIs.  It's taken from an old version of ColabKobold.  This is a heavily stripped down version of the engine we use.  We've also included a very basic text input system.  You can run this project straight from the Colab notebook we've linked to.  

## How to use this
We recommend running this straight from Colab, as it's setup to be run this way.  Just open the notebook, run the first cell, and once it has come up with a Quote Of The Day, run the 2nd cell.  The first inference from the engine is far slower than subsequent inferences, so we used the engine to generate a Quote Of The Day from inference on boot to ensure responses from the AI are rapid.
